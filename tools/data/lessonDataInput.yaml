    - q: What's your favourite weather? (Why?)
      a: 'Actually I prefer cloudy days, because then it''''s neither too hot nor too cold. And what''''s more important to me is that this weather is perfect for photography as the light is so soft. So at this time of day, I like to go out with my camera to take photos.'''
    - q: It lasts the whole year or a place with different seasons?
      a: 'In my hometown the weather is quite pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold most of the time. Even in winter, the temperature is still quite mild. But the summer is often hot and humid.'
    - q: What do you usually do during your favourite weather (or season)?
      a: 'The bad thing about the weather in my hometown is that it doesn''t snow as heavily as does up north like in Beijing for example. It does snow, but usually we just get a little bit. Every time I see children having a snowball flight or making a snowman on TV, I really envy them.'
    - q: What's the weather (usually) like in your hometown?
      a: 'I believe though China is a vast country, there are four distinct seasons in most places. But unfortunately in recent years, many places are becoming boiling hot in the summer. I guess the changes are primarily due to the greenhouse effect. So in this extreme weather, I will really prefer to work at home, and the air- conditioning is working all day long, and at night, I even sleep on the floor to be cooler.'
    - q: 'Do you like that weather (or, that kind of climate)? (Why? /Why not?)'
      a: 'Yes, Nanjing is facing more and more oppressive haze; I always keep a watchful eye on the weather forecast. I installed an app in my mobile phone, and I watch the PM 2.5 indicator it has become a bit of a routine for me.'
    - q: How often is the weather good in your hometown?
      a: 'As for the unusual weather, global warming has really become a hot topic around the world. It is caused by the greenhouse effect as the sheer volume of carbon dioxide emitted into the air, prevents the atmosphere from cooling off at night. As for other unusual weather, hurricanes, which can easily flatten thousands of homes near the coast in a short period of time, are becoming more common.'
    - q: What did you do the last time the weather was good?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I''d probably go with the distinct seasons in each year because each season has its own merits. I think I would get bored if it was warm all year round.'
    - q: Are there any bad points about the weather in your city?
      a: 'No, in spring and autumn, when the temperature is neither too cold nor too hot, people in China tend to hike in the mountains, or go running. When it comes to summer, people can choose more physical activities like swimming, camping in the forests and playing balls, etc. But in winter, people believe it not suitable for outdoor exercises, so they prefer to stay at home to keep warm.'

    - q: Do you think its Important to be on time?
      a: 'Yeah, I think it definitely is, because it''s basic good manners to be on time for things. You know, I think you''d agree it''s pretty rude to keep people waiting, and so it kind of gives a bad impression about that person.'
    - q: How do you feel when others are late?
      a: 'Well I guess it kind of depends, because I mean, if there''s a good reason for being late, you know, like getting stuck in traffic, then I will not really mind that much. But you know, if the person does not really have any excuse and it''s simply because they could not be bothered to arrive on time, then I suppose I might feel a bit annoyed.'
    - q: 'Are you, yourself, late very often?- How do you feel when you are late?'
      a: '(If yes) Yeah, I am. And I know it''s a bad habit, but for some reason, no matter how hard I try, I always seem to end up being late for things!'
    - q: How do you think you could be on time?
      a: '(If no) No, I would not say I am. You know, most of the time I''m pretty good with being on time for things, because I always make a quite big effort not to be late.'
    - q: Do you wear a watch?
      a: 'I feel pretty bad, especially if I''ve kept the other person waiting for a long time. So if I know I’m gonna be late, I will always try to let the person know in advance, you know, like send them a text message or something, so at least they know when to expect me.'
    - q: 'When does time SEEM to move fast, and when does it SEEM to move Slowly?'
      a: 'I guess the best thing to do would be to always allow lots of time to get anywhere. So for example, if it normally takes me, say, half an hour to get to the city centre, then I should probably leave home about an hour before I need to get there.'
    - q: 'If you could go back in time, what would you do differently?'

    - q: What (types of) programmes did you watch when you were a child?
      a: 'I became obsessed with various TV programmes, including the adverts. I can still remember my favourite cartoons like Transformers, Tom and Jerry, Dragon Ball, etc, which I watched all through my childhood.'
    - q: Do you think television has changed since you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, as the techniques have advanced in these years, the TV has also developed a lot. They have become thinner and clearer to be exact. I remember those old TV screens were made with a plasma panel, making the whole TV heavy and big. Then LCD technology and the LED display came out making the TV thinner and lighter so we can enjoy brighter and clearer programmes.'
    - q: Has television changed your life in any way?
      a: 'I believe that watching TV has benefited me in some way, as well as bringing me some detrimental consequences. Watching TV programmes had enabled me to broaden my horizons as I was born and raised in a small county and there were many places and things I had no opportunities to experience. But the TV had helped me to see them. But spending too much time in front of TV also made meaddicted to it and unfortunately harmed my eyes. So I’ve had to wear glasses since middle school'

    - q: Do you often visit a museum?
      a: 'Museums are really important in protecting, preserving, propagating and researching numerous human treasures. Once the antiques are in museums, they are permanently out of circulation, which means the public can see them.'
    - q: Did you go to any museums when you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, the reason is that generally, most museums are non-profit organisations, and these goods make up a large part of their income, except for the tickets of course, and also partly because these items are closely related to the theme of the museums, which cannot be bought in other bookstores or shops.'

    - q: What did you do during the last public holiday?
      a: 'I believe public holidays are rather important and there should be more of them in my country.

    - q: How often do you go to a cinema or watch a movie?
      a: 'I go to cinema to watch movies from time to time. Normally if I’m not busy with my work, I’ll check out the movies to see whether there are any movies that attract me; but if I have lots of things on my hands, I''ll probably focus on my work.'

      a: 'If I had to choose between the two, I''ll probably spend more time at home with my kid, telling stories to him or playing games with him, whereas, hanging out with friends will reduce my quality family time with my son.'
    - q: What do you usually do after work/after classes?

      a: 'No, I really couldn''t stand the school uniform because the clothes were a bit too old- fashioned; in addition, sometimes I was reluctant to wear them because they were too large.
