    - q: Who gave you your name?
      a: 'My parents gave me my name, my father to be exact.'
    - q: Does your name have any particular (or special) meaning?
      a: 'Zhi means knowledge, and Lei means accumulation. So I guess my parents wanted to tell me that being knowledgeable depends on accumulation. You see they put a lot of pressure on my shoulders with this name.'
    - q: Do you like your name?
      a: 'I quite like my name, and I won''t change it for the world, because it is unique. I don''t think that anyone else in China has the same name. It''s part of my identity, and it is meaningful to me.'
    - q: 'In your country, do people feel that their name is very important?'
      a: People in my country pay great attention to their names because they believe that suitable names will bring them good fortune. Sometimes they even change their names for their business and family purpose.
    - q: Would you like to change your name?
      a: 'In China, I believe that fathers are in the position of naming their children. Sometimes they will look through some Chinese classical literatures to seek the meaningful words for their children.'
    - q: Is it easy to change your name in your country?
      a: 'Oh, there are some nicknames that are very popular in China. For example, Lili means that their parents hope their daughters would be beautiful; and Kuan kuan, indicates that their sons would be magnanimous when they are grown up'

    - q: What's the weather like today?
      a: 'It''s really freezing (sunny, cool, breezy, chilly, warm, humid, hot) today. If I didn’t have to take the IELTS exams, I would prefer to stay at home.'
    - q: What's your favourite weather? (Why?)
      a: 'Actually I prefer cloudy days, because then it''''s neither too hot nor too cold. And what''''s more important to me is that this weather is perfect for photography as the light is so soft. So at this time of day, I like to go out with my camera to take photos.'''
    - q: It lasts the whole year or a place with different seasons?
      a: 'In my hometown the weather is quite pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold most of the time. Even in winter, the temperature is still quite mild. But the summer is often hot and humid.'
    - q: What do you usually do during your favourite weather (or season)?
      a: 'The bad thing about the weather in my hometown is that it doesn''t snow as heavily as does up north like in Beijing for example. It does snow, but usually we just get a little bit. Every time I see children having a snowball flight or making a snowman on TV, I really envy them.'
    - q: What's the weather (usually) like in your hometown?
      a: 'I believe though China is a vast country, there are four distinct seasons in most places. But unfortunately in recent years, many places are becoming boiling hot in the summer. I guess the changes are primarily due to the greenhouse effect. So in this extreme weather, I will really prefer to work at home, and the air- conditioning is working all day long, and at night, I even sleep on the floor to be cooler.'
    - q: 'Do you like that weather (or, that kind of climate)? (Why? /Why not?)'
      a: 'Yes, Nanjing is facing more and more oppressive haze; I always keep a watchful eye on the weather forecast. I installed an app in my mobile phone, and I watch the PM 2.5 indicator it has become a bit of a routine for me.'
    - q: How often is the weather good in your hometown?
      a: 'As for the unusual weather, global warming has really become a hot topic around the world. It is caused by the greenhouse effect as the sheer volume of carbon dioxide emitted into the air, prevents the atmosphere from cooling off at night. As for other unusual weather, hurricanes, which can easily flatten thousands of homes near the coast in a short period of time, are becoming more common.'
    - q: What did you do the last time the weather was good?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I''d probably go with the distinct seasons in each year because each season has its own merits. I think I would get bored if it was warm all year round.'
    - q: Are there any bad points about the weather in your city?
      a: 'No, in spring and autumn, when the temperature is neither too cold nor too hot, people in China tend to hike in the mountains, or go running. When it comes to summer, people can choose more physical activities like swimming, camping in the forests and playing balls, etc. But in winter, people believe it not suitable for outdoor exercises, so they prefer to stay at home to keep warm.'

  cname: punctuality
  pairs:
    - q: Do you think its Important to be on time?
      a: 'Yeah, I think it definitely is, because it''s basic good manners to be on time for things. You know, I think you''d agree it''s pretty rude to keep people waiting, and so it kind of gives a bad impression about that person.'
    - q: How do you feel when others are late?
      a: 'Well I guess it kind of depends, because I mean, if there''s a good reason for being late, you know, like getting stuck in traffic, then I will not really mind that much. But you know, if the person does not really have any excuse and it''s simply because they could not be bothered to arrive on time, then I suppose I might feel a bit annoyed.'
    - q: 'Are you, yourself, late very often?- How do you feel when you are late?'
      a: '(If yes) Yeah, I am. And I know it''s a bad habit, but for some reason, no matter how hard I try, I always seem to end up being late for things!'
    - q: How do you think you could be on time?
      a: '(If no) No, I would not say I am. You know, most of the time I''m pretty good with being on time for things, because I always make a quite big effort not to be late.'
    - q: Do you wear a watch?
      a: 'I feel pretty bad, especially if I''ve kept the other person waiting for a long time. So if I know I’m gonna be late, I will always try to let the person know in advance, you know, like send them a text message or something, so at least they know when to expect me.'
    - q: 'When does time SEEM to move fast, and when does it SEEM to move Slowly?'
      a: 'I guess the best thing to do would be to always allow lots of time to get anywhere. So for example, if it normally takes me, say, half an hour to get to the city centre, then I should probably leave home about an hour before I need to get there.'
    - q: 'If you could go back in time, what would you do differently?'

      a: 'I seldom watch TV. I only turn on the TV to watch a football match on weekends. That is once a week. I am a big fan of football so I watch a lot of football matches. It''s exciting and entertaining to see how players push their limits to win the games. I also enjoy watching movies, especially when I connect my computer to the TV screen and watch movies in High Definition from my bed; it is really enjoyable at night.'

    - q: Did you watch much TV when you were a child? (How much?)
      a: 'Oh, yes, I really was a couch potato when I was younger. On weekends, when my parents went out to do other things, I was left alone at home with the TV all day long. '
    - q: What (types of) programmes did you watch when you were a child?
      a: 'I became obsessed with various TV programmes, including the adverts. I can still remember my favourite cartoons like Transformers, Tom and Jerry, Dragon Ball, etc, which I watched all through my childhood.'
    - q: Do you think television has changed since you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, as the techniques have advanced in these years, the TV has also developed a lot. They have become thinner and clearer to be exact. I remember those old TV screens were made with a plasma panel, making the whole TV heavy and big. Then LCD technology and the LED display came out making the TV thinner and lighter so we can enjoy brighter and clearer programmes.'
    - q: Has television changed your life in any way?
      a: 'I believe that watching TV has benefited me in some way, as well as bringing me some detrimental consequences. Watching TV programmes had enabled me to broaden my horizons as I was born and raised in a small county and there were many places and things I had no opportunities to experience. But the TV had helped me to see them. But spending too much time in front of TV also made meaddicted to it and unfortunately harmed my eyes. So I’ve had to wear glasses since middle school'

      a: There are a lot of museums in Nanjing because Nanjing has a central place in the history of China. It allows the local residents to know more about their traditions and historical celebrities.
    - q: Do you think museums are useful for visitors to your hometown/country?
      a: 'I go to the museums a lot, when I go to a new place, I''ll find the local museums that have interesting features. The museum I visited last time was the Guanfu Museum located in the rural area of Beijing. It is a private-owned museum featuring Chinese antiques like porcelain, furniture, jade and some paintings.'
    - q: Do you often visit a museum?
      a: 'Museums are really important in protecting, preserving, propagating and researching numerous human treasures. Once the antiques are in museums, they are permanently out of circulation, which means the public can see them.'
    - q: Did you go to any museums when you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, the reason is that generally, most museums are non-profit organisations, and these goods make up a large part of their income, except for the tickets of course, and also partly because these items are closely related to the theme of the museums, which cannot be bought in other bookstores or shops.'

      a: 'Yes, there are so many people in my country, it''s really hard to say, and probably most people tend to go shopping with families or friends to take advantage of the sales in the shops, but personally speaking, I am afraid we don''t celebrate Christmas like the way people do in Western countries.Yes, I am fond of holidays. The main thing is that on these days, I don''t have to work and have plenty of time to relax and also I will have more quality time with my family.'
    - q: Do you like public holidays?
      a: 'I believe my favourite public holiday would be National Day because I get at least seven days to go travelling and also it''s the best time to get around, the weather is neither too cold nor too hot, and the foliage of trees will have turned yellow or red, which is very pretty.'
    - q: Which public holidays do you like the most?
      a: 'It''s kind of hard to say but people that I know around me tend to go shopping with their families or friends to take advantage of the sales in the shops, but maybe for others, they probably will stay at home to relax.'
    - q: What did you do during the last public holiday?
      a: 'I believe public holidays are rather important and there should be more of them in my country. The main factor is that people really need to unwind without any distractions after tiring work and also public holidays can dramatically boost consumption, as goods in the shops will be sold at a discount during these days.'

    - q: Do you like to watch films?
      a: I'm really into watching films because some films are very entertaining and provoking. I sometimes go to cinema with my friends and family to enjoy our leisure time in the weekends.
    - q: Do you prefer foreign films or Chinese films?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I would probably choose foreign films, especially Hollywood films because most of them are well-acted, with lots of charismatic celebrities and are often enormous box-office hits; whereas you know, Chinese films are usually low-budget, so they are not as attractive as their American counterparts.'
    - q: How often do you go to a cinema or watch a movie?
      a: 'I go to cinema to watch movies from time to time. Normally if I’m not busy with my work, I’ll check out the movies to see whether there are any movies that attract me; but if I have lots of things on my hands, I''ll probably focus on my work.'
    - q: Do Chinese people like to go to a cinema to watch a film?
      a: 'It''s kind of hard to say but people that I know tend to like watching movies in the cinema, but maybe for others, they just prefer to stay at home and watch TV programmes'
    - q: What kinds of movies do you like best?
      a: 'As for me, I like drama films the best because sometimes they just tell simple but warm and heartfelt stories with provoking and often emotional endings which touch me a lot.'
    - q: What was the first film that you watched?
      a: 'The first film that I watched was the Lion King many years ago in the cinema with my parents. What I can remember now is the terrific animation and the amazing soundtrack. I particularly liked the song Can You Feel the Love Tonight that I knew it was produced by Elton John. And I''ve learned lessons from this movie. It is about living up to our responsibilities, no matter how hard it is.'

    - q: What do you do in your spare time?
      a: 'Well, I enjoy driving around in my spare time. I always drive my car with my friends or family out to the countryside during the weekends to relax. I feel that driving not only enables me to go where I want to at any time, but I can also make my own itineraries and discover the stunning places that others may not find.'
    - q: What do you do to relax?

    - q: What do you usually do after work/after classes?
      a: 'Oh, definitely not, you know, a modern lifestyle brings people more convenience, however, in this modern fast paced society the fierce competition makes more people spend more time at work, resulting in less quality time with family and friends.'
    - q: Do you prefer to stay at home in the evenings or do you prefer to go out?
      a: 'Yes, definitely. After a tiring week, people really need to relax. Apart from earning money, I still need to enjoy my family time, hang out with friends to socialise and travel around to experience different lifestyles.'
    - q: Do you think modern lifestyles give people enough time for leisure?
      a: 'Well, between the two, old people are fond of a slow-pace of life compared to young people, for example, old people enjoy walking in the garden or chatting with old friends, on the contrary, young people are fond of energetic activities such as football and hiking in the mountains.'
    - q: Do you think people today have more time to relax than in the past?

    - q: Do you like maths?
      a: 'To be honest, I disliked maths because there were always too many abstract formulas I had to remember. You know, I was not good at memorising things, so I often used the incorrect formula in the exams, and made lots of mistakes and got low marks as a result.'
    - q: Who taught you maths?
      a: 'My maths teacher was an elderly woman. She was very kind and patient, but she always tended to be demanding with us, she seemed to like making the simplest theory very complicated. She also likes giving us endless homework to do.'
    - q: Who's your favourite teacher so far?
      a: 'Yes, I''m afraid that I wasn''t quick at figures. And I was also bored with these abstract formulas and found it hard to pick the appropriate ones to solve the maths problems in exams.'
    - q: Is maths difficult for you to learn?

      a: 'Well, as my hometown is a popular tourist destination and there is not so much industrial pollution, the sky is always clean and clear, and I can see the stunning night sky with the countless and glittering stars and sometimes even the galaxy. But unfortunately in a metropolis like Nanjing light pollution makes the night sky invisible.'

    - q: Do you like reading books? Why or why not?
      a: 'Yes, I''m really into reading because I believe that reading can be both entertaining and educational. Reading broadens my knowledge by opening up the whole world to me. While I''m reading, I can be visiting another country or a different time period, or travelling through space. I can find out how people solved problems or think up new ideas.'
    - q: What (kinds of) books do you like to read?
      a: 'Oh, it''s a tough question, or it should be more of what books I don''t read. I have a really open mind towards books and what genre they are. Classic literature, novels, autobiography, historical story - whatever I love reading them all.'
    - q: Did you read much when you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, I remember when I was a kid, I''d like to take some historical books from my father''s bookshelf, and read the historical stories, which were really entertaining and educational for me. As a result, I''m very familiar with our ancient Chinese history.'
    - q: What (kinds of) books did you like reading when you were a child?
      a: 'It''s kind of hard to say but young children that I know tend to read fairy tales to cultivate their mental development, but maybe for others, they just want to watch TV and play with their toys.'
    - q: Do (young) children like reading books?
      a: 'I believe if you want your children to be smart, they have to acquire a love for reading, which has numerous benefits. Reading opens the door to a child''s early academic success, imparts a love of learning and leads to higher grades in every subject. Besides, reading can help children improve linguistic skills in the form of a richer vocabulary, correct grammar, and more articulate oral communication. On top of that, books teach child about relationships, situations, personalities, and what is good and what is bad in the world he/she lives in.'

    - q: How many hours do you sleep every day?
      a: 'Usually I sleep for seven to eight hours every night in order to let my body relax. But if I want to do something very important at night, I could, at a push, sleep for less than four hours.'
    - q: Is it necessary to take a nap every day?
      a: 'Yes, I believe that after having lunch at noon, it''s beneficial to take a nap; half an hour’s snooze would be enough, to brace oneself for the tasks of the afternoon.'
    - q: Do old people sleep a lot? Why?
      a: 'Yes, I guess elderly people do need to sleep more. I believe the reason is that after years of working and stress the natural process breaks down a person’s body until all they want to do is sleep; consequently, their bodies take longer to recharge their batteries.'
    - q: How to have a good sleep?
      a: 'I believe you have to follow several rules to get a regular good nights sleep. Firstly, go to bed at the same time every night. Choose a time when you normally feel tired, so that you don''t toss and turn. Also, make sure your bed is comfortable so that you can stretch and turn in bed. As well as that, stay away from big meals at night or try to make dinnertime earlier in the evening, and avoid heavy, rich foods before bed.'
    - q: Do you like to get up early in the morning?
      a: 'Yes, getting up early in the morning is really beneficial for our health, because we can enjoy the fresh air in the morning; besides we have plenty of time to do some physical exercises liking running and jogging. In the morning I can also prepare a good dinner for the family.'
    - q: Can you sleep well if you are in a noisy environment?
      a: 'Well, I''m afraid that at night I can''t fall asleep in such a noisy place what with barking dogs, loud neighbours and city traffic. This is because I used to sleep in my quiet hometown when I was a kid. So sometimes I envy people who have grown accustomed to environmental noise and can sleep well wherever they lay their head.'

    - q: Are there any important trees in your country?
      a: 'There are many important trees in my country. The use of bamboo, for example, can be used for everything from furniture making to building construction. Also, weeping willow trees symbolised new hope in ancient China, therefore, there are many poems complimenting them.'
    - q: Is there a forest near your hometown?
      a: Yes. It's just the world-renowned Huangshan Mountain with various kinds of trees living there; the most famous are the pine trees.
    - q: Would you like to live in a place that has a lot of trees?
      a: 'Yes, I''m really into getting close to nature cos I believe it''s the most healthy and natural way of living. Although it''s unreasonable to have such a polluted lifestyle in Nanjing now, I still keep hold of that dream for my future life.'
    - q: Where can one find trees (or forests) in your country?
      a: 'I guess trees can be easily seen in my country. If you are in cities, there are always many sycamore trees along the streets and if you are in the suburb areas, you will see forests of various sizes.'
    - q: Do you think places with trees attract more visitors than places with few trees?
      a: 'Well, yes. Obviously places with lots of trees are shadier, cooler, more humid and much less windy, therefore, people feel more comfortable and more likely to get close to nature.'
    - q: Did you ever climb trees when you were a child?
      a: 'Yes, of course. There are many trees in my community. When I was a kid, I always climbed trees to get higher or to find birds'' eggs.'
    - q: Have you ever planted a tree?
      a: 'Yes, once. Thinking back I remember when my middle school organized a hiking trip to a mountainous area, we planted several saplings in the forest, I guess they have grown up into big trees already.'
    - q: Do you think more people should plant trees?
      a: 'Yes, I believe more trees should be planted both in and outside the cities because they can absorb the pollutant gases and provide more oxygen; besides, trees can save water and prevent soil erosion. Therefore, trees are critically important to keep our eco-system balanced. We are supposed to not only plant more trees, but also protect the existing ones.'

    - q: 'Which do you prefer reading, magazines or newspapers?'
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I''ll probably go with reading magazines in my spare time because they are well printed and always have in-depth reporting on particular events; whereas, you know, newspapers always report the same news as the Internet, so they now seem to be not so indispensable.'
    - q: What kinds of newspapers (or magazines) do you usually read?
      a: 'I''m more interested in newspapers that write about foreign cultures. I like to learn about their religions, customs, and the foods they eat. Occasionally, foreign news interests me, too. I also really like reading scientific related news.'
    - q: How old were you when you first started to read newspapers?
      a: 'I got in the habit of reading newspapers when I was in high school; I was around 17 years old then. The library in my school had several kinds of newspapers and magazines so when I had free time, I''d go to read news about the latest political events, sports and fashion news.'
    - q: Do you think it's important to read newspapers? (Why? /Why not?)
      a: 'Yes, I feel that it''s very important for me and other people to know what’s happened both domestically and internationally.'
    - q: Why do you think people read newspapers?

    - q: What different types of newspapers are there in China?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I''ll probably go with reading domestic news because it is closer to home, and it affects me more; whereas, you know, international news sometimes have nothing to do with my daily life, so I just read the headlines.'
    - q: Do you care about the news?
      a: 'Well, I feel that newspaper publishers always try to use bold headings, attractive advertisements, and insights in the article to get the readers'' attention.'
    - q: Is the news important to you?

    - q: What kinds of news do Chinese people read in newspapers?
      a: 'Yes, getting news from the Internet is popular now because it''s very convenient to get news from the Internet via a mobile phone. The news apps on my mobile phone usually send me the most urgent notifications so it keeps me posted minute by minute.'

    - q: What's the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
      a: 'Well, people in my hometown always seem to ride ebikes to go work or somewhere else because my hometown is a small town and it''s very convenient to go out by ebike.'
    - q: How often do you take buses?
      a: 'I rarely go by bus because I have my own car now, so I always go somewhere by car.'
    - q: Can you compare the advantages of planes and trains?
      a: 'Well, between the two, travelling by plane is relatively very fast, for example, it just takes three hours for me to go to Beijing but it is quite expensive; on the other hand, travelling by trains is an increasingly cost-effective alternative to planes, particularly if I''m going a relatively short distance.'
    - q: Is driving to work popular in your country?
      a: 'Yes, people that I know tend to go to work by car because it''s very convenient to drive, but for others without cars, they just take buses or ride an ebike to work because it''s cheap and effective'
    - q: Do you think people will drive more in the future?
      a: 'Yes, I believe that as people earn more money and have a better life, they will buy cars for themselves and their families, and most will drive their cars to the office.'
    - q: Would you ride bikes to work in the future?
      a: 'Oh no, it''s impossible to ride a bike to work because you know, Nanjing is a big city, I live about 20 kilometres from the office, so I''ll be late if I rode a bike to work.'
    - q: What will become the most popular means of transportation in China?
      a: 'I believe private transportation will become the most popular means of transportation in my country because as people get richer, people will tend to buy cars for their families and businesses, and obviously China has already become the biggest market for vehicles in the world.'
    - q: Do you prefer public transportation or private transportation?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I''d probably go to work in my own car because it''s much more comfortable than being in a crowded bus or subway.'

  pairs:
    - q: Do you write many letters or emails?
      a: 'Yes, I write emails as part of my job to my clients on a daily basis. There are many things I have to write, for example, I usually write end user training for my clients to teach them how to use the system, or I write a development guide for my technical staff to tell them how to code.'
    - q: Who do you usually write to?
      a: 'If I had to choose between the two, I''d probably go with writing with a computer. In this age of fast living and convenience, writing things with a computer is more efficient. Whereas, handwriting is really time consuming and hard to share.'
    - q: Do you prefer to write letters by hand or to use a computer?
      a: 'Well, between the two, a letter is printed or handwritten on actual paper and sent through the mail while an email is typed on a computer, tablet or Smartphone and sent electronically. While emails have become a more popular way of communication for individuals and businesses, traditional letters still have a place in today''s modern, tech-oriented society.'
    - q: How often do you write an email or a letter?
      a: 'Normally part of my daily routine is to write emails to my clients about how to use the system; but if they complain to me about a poor user experience, I sometimes really find myself getting stuck in to explaining what went wrong just to comfort them.'
    - q: What are the differences between emails and letters?
      a: I would be feeling both honoured and excited to receive a letter or email from someone because the sender has spent time writing it. Especially when someone writes to me to appreciate what I’ve done or to compliment me about my work.
    - q: Is it hard to think of what to write?
      a: 'Well, if I had to choose between the two, I will probably go with writing an email because I can spend plenty of time thinking about how to express my opinions correctly and clearly, besides, the whole conversation can be tracked in the electronic mail; whereas, you know, making a telephone call usually leads to misunderstanding because sometimes it is not very clear and things get missed'
    - q: What kinds of letter/email do you think is the hardest to write?
      a: 'I believe that as a major method of communication between people, letter writing has a long and interesting history; besides, handwritten letters are personal. They show the receiver that someone has spent time and effort in communicating with them. They are a way of connecting two people that cannot be achieved through the impersonal use of texts or instant messages. Therefore, I think that handwritten letters will still be around in the future.'

    - q: Are there many places to swim near you?
      a: 'Yes, there are a few public swimming pools. There is the main indoor one at a big sports complex in the centre of town. There are also a couple of outdoor ones, but you can only use them in summer, as it is too cold in winter. There is a big one in a park, whereas the other is much smaller.'
    - q: Do you think everyone should learn to swim?
      a: 'Of course, I think it''s very important to learn to swim. First, you might spend a lot of holidays by water, for example, when you go to the beach or go to a lake, so you won''t be able to enjoy yourself with your friends if you can''t swim. Also, for safety reasons it''s very important. You often hear about accidents involving young children so it''s very important.'

    - q: What kinds of snacks are popular in your country?
      a: 'Well, I guess that most people eat junk food like crisps, chocolate and biscuits for their snacks. I suppose office workers mainly eat junk food like biscuits but other people sometimes eat fruit or something healthier.'
    - q: Do you think eating snacks is good for your health?
      a: 'I think that if you’re hungry, it’s perfectly fine to have some fruit but if people eat junk food between meals, then it’s really unhealthy.'

      a: 'Yes, I am a big fan of doing photography in my spare time. I always travel around with my camera. It’s a habit I’ve had for almost 8 years. The main thing is that I can capture the most precious moments in my life, such as a graduation ceremony, or a sweet moment with my girlfriend, and also I believe photography helps to cultivate my thinking about the world.'
    - q: Do you prefer to take photos yourself or to have other people take photos? (Why?)
      a: 'If I had to choose between the two, I''ll probably go with taking photos of other people because I feel that different people have different characteristic, so each photos will be different. Whereas, I rarely take a selfie because it makes me embarrassed.'

      a: 'Normally, I''ll probably just go out and about to take photos because I really enjoy natural scenery such as the seashore, sunsets and twilight, but when I take my son with me, I take photos of him to capture his happiness.'
    - q: How (Why) did you become interested in photography?

    - q: Do you like to learn about history?
      a: 'Yes, I am a big fan of reading historical stories. When I was a little boy, I always took the historical books from my father''s bookshelf and read about historical events. I feel that history not only helps me learn, but also gives me a better understanding of human society.'
    - q: What historical event do you find most interesting?
      a: Personally I am fond of the Battle of Red Cliffs which happened during the early period of the Three Kingdoms. This was a decisive battle at the end of the Han Dynasty. It was also a typical battle in Chinese history renowned for a smaller and weaker army defeating a larger and stronger foe.
    - q: Do you think history is important?
      a: 'Yes, the main factor is that like our native language and our history forms our cultural identity and provides a unique record of our country. We can learn from the experiences of history to correct our current actions.'
    - q: Do you like to watch programmes on TV about history?
      a: 'Yes, I enjoy watching documentaries about history on TV because I can see a lot of materials that cannot be seen in the textbooks. I watch them at home during my time off with my son to learn something about history.'
    - q: Do you think you can really learn history from films and TV programmes?
      a: 'I don''t feel that watching current TV series can make you more aware of the history. TV programmes are more engaging than books, however, true historical events in most of the TV series have been distorted by the producers to cater for the audience. It''s really a shame, as young people will misunderstand history as presented by these companies.'
    - q: Do you think the Internet is a good place to learn about history?
      a: Yes. History is full of debates but you can understand both sides of the story by going online which will help you to become aware of the true facts and be able to think critically about these things. I’m always Googling for interesting historical materials about the Song Dynasty. I want to know the truth of the matter.
    - q: Can you name a person from history who you would like to learn more about?
      a: 'The person I''d like to learn about is Wu Chengen, the author of A Journey to the West. He combined folk tales and his own imagination to write this great fairy story in the 16th century. I want to know about his personality and find out as much as possible about him. I believe that his imagination is what is lacking in many writers nowadays.'

They firstly learn the basic elements of the Chinese characters, then the simple characters, and finally the complicated ones. They will have to do a lot of writing practice to remember them. The more they practice, the better they write.'

    - q: Do you often like to listen to music?
      a: 'Yes, I’ve been a big fan of music for many years. I sometimes listen to music for about one hour before sleeping at night and also when I am driving. I am very fond of pop music from Taiwan and Hong Kong and I also frequently listen to some American pop singers like the Backstreet Boys. I can feel their energy when I listen to their music.'
    - q: When do you listen to music?
      a: 'Personally, I am interested in traditional instrumental music, like the erhu, mixed with pianos and guitars.'
    - q: How much time do you spend listening to music every day?
      a: 'I always have time to listen to music during the weekends. It is an impressive combination that is both nostalgic and modern at the same time. I first encountered this type of music when I was driving and listening to the radio about five years ago, I forget the name, but the tune sounded really amazing.'
    - q: What kinds of music do you like to listen to?
      a: 'Oh, yes, I saw a pop singer perform several years ago. It was a really memorable night as the live performances were very exciting. I remembered that after the song, when the singer spoke to the audience, everyone cheered and clapped like crazy. It made me feel so cool being there.'
    - q: What's your favourite kind of music?
      a: 'Unfortunately, I did not learn to play any type of musical instrument when I was a little boy. I remember that in schools, teachers always told us to put all our energy into studying and preparing for exams. The music lessons, along with physical exercises and paintings, were not so important as the schools claimed them to be. It was a disappointment for me when I grew up.'
    - q: How often do you listen to that type of music?
      a: 'I don’t get enough time to listen to music because I have to spend all my time studying. This was one of my biggest disappointments during my childhood, so when I got to university the first thing I did was to buy a new mp3 player.'
    - q: When did you start listening to this type of music?
      a: 'I believe that currently in China the most popular music is pop music. There are many famous pop singers now, they are releasing numerous albums every year, and they are always trendy for a short period of time.'

      a: My favourite teacher in my middle school was my physics teacher his name was Mr. Zhang. He was the most influential teacher I have ever had. He taught us a lot of background stuff about physics to encourage and motivate us because physics is quite complicated and difficult for us. I still remember that he frequently told us that physics was gymnastics for the brain. He really inspired my enthusiasm to learn it as well as I could.
    - q: Why do you like the teacher?
      a: 'I don''t think I would be a good teacher; I am not a patient man and cannot bear to repeat the same things frequently. A teachers'' job would be really boring for me, you have to make your explanations as easy as possible for students to fully understand. It is a challenging job, I am afraid I cannot do it.'
