## Answers
Here are some model answers!

Try to make up your own answers first!

- Do you think its Important to be on time?
  - Yeah, I think it definitely is, because it&#39;s basic good manners to be on time for things. You know, I think you&#39;d agree it&#39;s pretty rude to keep people waiting, and so it kind of gives a bad impression about that person.
- How do you feel when others are late?
  - Well I guess it kind of depends, because I mean, if there&#39;s a good reason for being late, you know, like getting stuck in traffic, then I will not really mind that much. But you know, if the person does not really have any excuse and it&#39;s simply because they could not be bothered to arrive on time, then I suppose I might feel a bit annoyed.
- Are you, yourself, late very often?- How do you feel when you are late?
  - (If yes) Yeah, I am. And I know it&#39;s a bad habit, but for some reason, no matter how hard I try, I always seem to end up being late for things!
- How do you think you could be on time?
  - (If no) No, I would not say I am. You know, most of the time I&#39;m pretty good with being on time for things, because I always make a quite big effort not to be late.
- Do you wear a watch?
  - I feel pretty bad, especially if I&#39;ve kept the other person waiting for a long time. So if I know I’m gonna be late, I will always try to let the person know in advance, you know, like send them a text message or something, so at least they know when to expect me.
