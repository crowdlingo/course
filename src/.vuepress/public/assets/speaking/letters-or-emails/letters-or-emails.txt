## Answers
Here are some model answers!

Try to make up your own answers first!

- Do you write many letters or emails?
  - Yes, I write emails as part of my job to my clients on a daily basis. There are many things I have to write, for example, I usually write end user training for my clients to teach them how to use the system, or I write a development guide for my technical staff to tell them how to code.
- Who do you usually write to?
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;d probably go with writing with a computer. In this age of fast living and convenience, writing things with a computer is more efficient. Whereas, handwriting is really time consuming and hard to share.
- Do you prefer to write letters by hand or to use a computer?
  - Well, between the two, a letter is printed or handwritten on actual paper and sent through the mail while an email is typed on a computer, tablet or Smartphone and sent electronically. While emails have become a more popular way of communication for individuals and businesses, traditional letters still have a place in today&#39;s modern, tech-oriented society.
- How often do you write an email or a letter?
  - Normally part of my daily routine is to write emails to my clients about how to use the system; but if they complain to me about a poor user experience, I sometimes really find myself getting stuck in to explaining what went wrong just to comfort them.
- What are the differences between emails and letters?
  - I would be feeling both honoured and excited to receive a letter or email from someone because the sender has spent time writing it. Especially when someone writes to me to appreciate what I’ve done or to compliment me about my work.
