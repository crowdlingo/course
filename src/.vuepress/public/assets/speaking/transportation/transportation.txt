- What&#39;s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
  - Well, people in my hometown always seem to ride ebikes to go work or somewhere else because my hometown is a small town and it&#39;s very convenient to go out by ebike.
- How often do you take buses?
  - I rarely go by bus because I have my own car now, so I always go somewhere by car.
- Can you compare the advantages of planes and trains?
  - Well, between the two, travelling by plane is relatively very fast, for example, it just takes three hours for me to go to Beijing but it is quite expensive; on the other hand, travelling by trains is an increasingly cost-effective alternative to planes, particularly if I&#39;m going a relatively short distance.
- Is driving to work popular in your country?
  - Yes, people that I know tend to go to work by car because it&#39;s very convenient to drive, but for others without cars, they just take buses or ride an ebike to work because it&#39;s cheap and effective
- Do you think people will drive more in the future?
  - Yes, I believe that as people earn more money and have a better life, they will buy cars for themselves and their families, and most will drive their cars to the office.
