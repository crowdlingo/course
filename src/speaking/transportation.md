- What&#39;s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
  - Well, people in my hometown always seem to ride ebikes to go work or somewhere else because my hometown is a small town and it&#39;s very convenient to go out by ebike.
- How often do you take buses?
  - I rarely go by bus because I have my own car now, so I always go somewhere by car.
- Can you compare the advantages of planes and trains?
  - Well, between the two, travelling by plane is relatively very fast, for example, it just takes three hours for me to go to Beijing but it is quite expensive; on the other hand, travelling by trains is an increasingly cost-effective alternative to planes, particularly if I&#39;m going a relatively short distance.
- Is driving to work popular in your country?
  - Yes, people that I know tend to go to work by car because it&#39;s very convenient to drive, but for others without cars, they just take buses or ride an ebike to work because it&#39;s cheap and effective
- Do you think people will drive more in the future?
  - Yes, I believe that as people earn more money and have a better life, they will buy cars for themselves and their families, and most will drive their cars to the office.
- Would you ride bikes to work in the future?
  - Oh no, it&#39;s impossible to ride a bike to work because you know, Nanjing is a big city, I live about 20 kilometres from the office, so I&#39;ll be late if I rode a bike to work.
- What will become the most popular means of transportation in China?
  - I believe private transportation will become the most popular means of transportation in my country because as people get richer, people will tend to buy cars for their families and businesses, and obviously China has already become the biggest market for vehicles in the world.
- Do you prefer public transportation or private transportation?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I&#39;d probably go to work in my own car because it&#39;s much more comfortable than being in a crowded bus or subway.
