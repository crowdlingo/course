- What public holidays do you have in your country?
  - We celebrate a lot of public festivals in my country. I am sure you know about the Spring Festival which is the most important one. In addition, we get together with our family for the Mid- Autumn Day and the National Day.
- Do people in your country celebrate Christmas?
  - Yes, there are so many people in my country, it&#39;s really hard to say, and probably most people tend to go shopping with families or friends to take advantage of the sales in the shops, but personally speaking, I am afraid we don&#39;t celebrate Christmas like the way people do in Western countries.Yes, I am fond of holidays. The main thing is that on these days, I don&#39;t have to work and have plenty of time to relax and also I will have more quality time with my family.
- Do you like public holidays?
  - I believe my favourite public holiday would be National Day because I get at least seven days to go travelling and also it&#39;s the best time to get around, the weather is neither too cold nor too hot, and the foliage of trees will have turned yellow or red, which is very pretty.
- Which public holidays do you like the most?
  - It&#39;s kind of hard to say but people that I know around me tend to go shopping with their families or friends to take advantage of the sales in the shops, but maybe for others, they probably will stay at home to relax.
- What did you do during the last public holiday?
  - I believe public holidays are rather important and there should be more of them in my country. The main factor is that people really need to unwind without any distractions after tiring work and also public holidays can dramatically boost consumption, as goods in the shops will be sold at a discount during these days.
