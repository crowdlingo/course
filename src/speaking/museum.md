## Answers

- Are there many (or, any) museums in your hometown?
  - There are a lot of museums in Nanjing because Nanjing has a central place in the history of China. It allows the local residents to know more about their traditions and historical celebrities.
- Do you think museums are useful for visitors to your hometown&#x2F;country?
  - I go to the museums a lot, when I go to a new place, I&#39;ll find the local museums that have interesting features. The museum I visited last time was the Guanfu Museum located in the rural area of Beijing. It is a private-owned museum featuring Chinese antiques like porcelain, furniture, jade and some paintings.
- Do you often visit a museum?
  - Museums are really important in protecting, preserving, propagating and researching numerous human treasures. Once the antiques are in museums, they are permanently out of circulation, which means the public can see them.
- Did you go to any museums when you were a child?
  - Yes, the reason is that generally, most museums are non-profit organisations, and these goods make up a large part of their income, except for the tickets of course, and also partly because these items are closely related to the theme of the museums, which cannot be bought in other bookstores or shops.
