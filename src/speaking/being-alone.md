- Do you like to be alone?
  - Yes, I like to be alone especially if I have to do something without interruption. But if I have spare time I would prefer stay with my friends to enjoy time together.
- What do you like to do when you are alone?
  - I really enjoy being alone during the mornings at the weekend. I can read some books and play computer games. During that time, I can do something I am interested in, and don&#39;t have to worry about anything.
- Do you like to spend time with your friends or just stay at home on your own?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I will probably go with hanging out with my close friends because such friendships really adds spice to my life; whereas, you know, spending too much time being alone is really boring.
- When was the last time you were being alone?
  - The last time I stayed alone at home was when my wife went on a business trip with our child for several days. So I was living, eating, sleeping at home alone. It was quite a quiet time so I could do what I wanted when I wanted to do it. .
