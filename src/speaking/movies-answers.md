### Do you like to watch films?

I’m really into watching films because some films are very entertaining and provoking. I sometimes go to the cinema with my friends and family to enjoy our leisure time on the weekends.

### How often do you go to a cinema or watch a movie?

I go the the cinema to watch movies from time to time. Normally if I’m not busy with my work, I’ll check out the movies to see whether there are any movies that attract me; but if I have lots of things on my hands, I’ll probably focus on my work.

### What was the first film that you watched?

The first film that I watched was the Lion King many years ago in the cinema with my parents. What I can remember now is the terrific animation and the amazing soundtrack. i particularly liked the song Can You Feel the Love Tonight that I knew it was produced by Elton John. And I’ve learned lessons from this movie. It is about living up to our responsibilities, no matter how hard it is.


### Do you think people will continue to go to the cinema in the future?

Well, I don’t know. Maybe they will. A lot of people go to the cinemas because they enjoy the outing. For them the cinema is an escape from their routine. I think they will continue to go to the cinema.

### Statistics show that visits to the cinema are up despite the availability of DVDs and online downloads. Why do you think this might be?

I think it’s the whole experience that the cinema offers … going out to see a film when it goes on general release … and seeing it on the big screen is more exciting than watching the film at home on TV … especially if it’s an action movie … and watching it with others makes it even more special


### Do old people and young people like watching the same kinds of films?
Well, I think that old people like to watch stories about their country since they wore so involved in this time period. They also like to watch a variety of programmes that show the native singing and dancing from different regions in my country. Young, people on the other hand, go for the foreign films, as I already mentioned. There are some films that both young and old like to watch such as historical movies.

### To what extent do you think films reflect real life?
Well, it is a big argument that has been around for a long time. Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? I believe that each reflects on the other. Sometimes films observe life and comment on it and sometimes life observes film and imitates it. Film is a powerful medium and brings many parts of life to the public for observation.
