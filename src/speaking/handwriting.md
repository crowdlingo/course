## Answers

- Do you often write things?
  - Yes, I write documentaries as part of my job on a daily basis for my clients. There are many things I have to write, for example, I usually write end user training for my clients to teach them how to use the system, or I write a development guide for my technical staffs to teach them how to code.
- Do you write everyday?
  - Yes, I&#39;m really into communicating with my clients by email. I send emails to them on a daily basis from my office, discussing business, guiding them how to use the system and solving their problems. I like sending emails because I can trace the communication in email software. It is much more useful than the telephone.
- What do you usually write?
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with writing things on a computer. I believe that in this age of fast living and convenience, writing things on computers can be fast and efficient. Whereas, handwriting is really time consuming and hard to share.
- Do you like writing to people?
  - Well, there are so many people in my country, it&#39;s really hard to say, probably most people write something on computers, for example, people like to write blogs to share their feelings with friends on the internet, but personally speaking, I don&#39;t think that writing without pens can be called writing.
- How often do you send e-mails?
  - In China, children usually learn to write in elementary school. They firstly learn the basic elements of the Chinese characters, then the simple characters, and finally the complicated ones. They will have to do a lot of writing practice to remember them. The more they practice, the better they write.
- What are your main reasons for using e-mails?
  - Yes, I feel that handwriting allows people to have more opportunity because if you have decent handwriting, people will admire you and you are considered to be both well educated and literate.
