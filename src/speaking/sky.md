## Answers

- Do you like to watch the sky?
  - Yes, I am really into watching the sky especially at night to count the millions of stars above. When I was a kid. I remember I sometimes laid down on the grass for hours to watch the shining stars during the summer because I was fond of imaging my favourite folk stories about the stars.
- What is the sky like at night in your hometown?
  - Well, as my hometown is a popular tourist destination and there is not so much industrial pollution, the sky is always clean and clear, and I can see the stunning night sky with the countless and glittering stars and sometimes even the galaxy. But unfortunately in a metropolis like Nanjing light pollution makes the night sky invisible.
- Do you like to watch stars?
  - No, I have never been on any sort of courses about stars because actually there were no such courses in the schools or university. But fortunately my grandmother once sent me an encyclopaedia about nature in which there were loads of stories about stars, I got most of my knowledge about the stars from it.
- Have you ever taken a course about stars?
  - Yes, I believe that astronomy has always had a significant impact on our world view as it can help us open our eyes, give context to our place in the cosmos and that can definitely reshape how we see the world.
- Is it important to study stars?
  - My favourite star constellation is Orion. It&#39;s very easy to spot on winter nights. Firstly, it has a huge red giant star, which may explode any time soon. Besides, it has a massive blue star which is very young. On top of that it also has a big nebula where new stars are being born - so it has everything!
- What&#39;s your favourite star?
