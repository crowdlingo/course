- How often do you like to hang out with friends?
  - I hang out with my friends from time to time. Normally if we have lots of time on the weekends, we will go to the cinema to watch movies to have a good time. We might also have dinner together in a restaurant if we have the time.
- Who do you usually like to hang out with?
  - Usually I like to hang out with one of my close friends. Actually we live in the same community so we can meet frequently. Also, both of our kids are in the same class in kindergarten, so we like to take them to the park or playground together.
- Where do you like to go when you hang out with your friends?
  - Well, that depends. We sometimes go to a restaurant to enjoy tasty food if someone knows a decent place. Also if we have plenty of time we like to plan a hike or camp in a nearby forest park to enjoy outdoor life. That would be a very memorable experience.
- Do you like to go out with a big group or just few friends?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I would probably go with hanging out with a big group people because I think that I am an extrovert. I like to meet different people to know about different kinds of life and make myself more sociable; whereas, you know, with only a few people around, it would be hard to find something interesting to do, such as travelling, hiking, etc.
