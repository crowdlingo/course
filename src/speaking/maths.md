## Answers

- When did you start learning maths?
  - I firstly started to learn maths when I was in the first grade in primary school. I was about seven years old then.
- Do you like maths?
  - To be honest, I disliked maths because there were always too many abstract formulas I had to remember. You know, I was not good at memorising things, so I often used the incorrect formula in the exams, and made lots of mistakes and got low marks as a result.
- Who taught you maths?
  - My maths teacher was an elderly woman. She was very kind and patient, but she always tended to be demanding with us, she seemed to like making the simplest theory very complicated. She also likes giving us endless homework to do.
- Who&#39;s your favourite teacher so far?
  - Yes, I&#39;m afraid that I wasn&#39;t quick at figures. And I was also bored with these abstract formulas and found it hard to pick the appropriate ones to solve the maths problems in exams.
- Is maths difficult for you to learn?
  - No, actually we were not allowed to use the calculator in class or exams because we were asked to calculate the results with pencil and paper. Therefore I&#39;m not that used to using a calculator now.
- Do you like to use a calculator?
