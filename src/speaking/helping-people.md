- Do you like to help others?
  - I am very happy to help others especially my neighbours. Getting alone well with your neighbours is very important if you want to lead a happy life.
- When was your last time you helped others?
  - Well, let me tell you about a time when I helped someone who I was not familiar with. One morning, I met an old lady who lived in the same building as me in a local shop. She had just bought a bag of rice and was ready to take the heavy bag home. I saw that she was having problems trying to life it up. I walked straight over to her, and said that I would take the bag home for her. She was very thankful for my kindness. I could see that she really needed someone would stand out and do her a kind favour.
- Did your parents teach you the importance of helping others?
  - When I was young, my parents and teachers taught me a lot about helping others. It is a core virtue in my culture, the solidarity of community is the thing that keeps members of society connected so we are always willing to help each other
- Have you ever refused to help others?
  - Yeah, sometimes when I am in hurry or on business I don’t have time so I have to say sorry that I can’t help
