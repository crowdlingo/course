- How often do you like to hang out with friends?
  - I hang out with my friends from time to time. Normally if we have a lot of time at the weekends, we might go to the cinema to watch movies. We can take our kids to have a good time. If we don&#39;t have that much time maybe we will just have dinner together in a restaurant.
- Who do you usually like to hang out with?
  - Usually I like to hang out with one of my close friends. Actually we live in the same community so we can meet frequently. Also both of our kids are in the same class in kindergarten, so we like to take them to the park or playground together.
- Where do you like to go when you hang out with your friends?
  - Well, that depends. Sometimes we go to a restaurant to enjoy tasty food if someone knows a decent place. But if we have plenty of time, we like to plan a hike or camp in a nearby forest park to enjoy the countryside. That would be a very memorable experience.
- Do you like to go out with a big group or just few friends?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I would go with hanging out with a big group people because I feel that I am an extrovert. I like to meet different people and get to know about them and their different kinds of life. I like to be sociable whereas, you know, with few people around, it would be hard to find something interesting to do, such as travelling, hiking, etc.
