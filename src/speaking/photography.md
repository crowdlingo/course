## Answers

- Do you like to take photographs?
  - Yes, I am a big fan of doing photography in my spare time. I always travel around with my camera. It’s a habit I’ve had for almost 8 years. The main thing is that I can capture the most precious moments in my life, such as a graduation ceremony, or a sweet moment with my girlfriend, and also I believe photography helps to cultivate my thinking about the world.
- Do you prefer to take photos yourself or to have other people take photos? (Why?)
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with taking photos of other people because I feel that different people have different characteristic, so each photos will be different. Whereas, I rarely take a selfie because it makes me embarrassed.
- How long have you liked taking photographs?
  - Normally, I&#39;ll probably just go out and about to take photos because I really enjoy natural scenery such as the seashore, sunsets and twilight, but when I take my son with me, I take photos of him to capture his happiness.
- How (Why) did you become interested in photography?
  - I store my photos both on my computer disk and on the Internet for backup. Also I have been running a photography website for 4 years, and I keep all my best photos there.
- How often do you take photographs?
  - Yes, I used to print some photos of my kid to hang in his room, they help us have good memories of the happy times we have together.
- In what situations do you take photographs?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with my own photos because they are unique and getting a lot of positive comments from friends is a pleasant thing. Whereas postcards are not as meaningful to me as the photos I take myself.
