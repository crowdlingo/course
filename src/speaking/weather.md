- What is the weather like today?
  - It&#39;s really freezing (sunny, cool, breezy, chilly, warm, humid, hot) today. If I didn’t have to take the IELTS exams, I would prefer to stay at home.
- What&#39;s your favourite weather? (Why?)
  - Actually I prefer cloudy days, because then it&#39;&#39;s neither too hot nor too cold. And what&#39;&#39;s more important to me is that this weather is perfect for photography as the light is so soft. So at this time of day, I like to go out with my camera to take photos.&#39;
- It lasts the whole year or a place with different seasons?
  - In my hometown the weather is quite pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold most of the time. Even in winter, the temperature is still quite mild. But the summer is often hot and humid.
- What do you usually do during your favourite weather (or season)?
  - The bad thing about the weather in my hometown is that it doesn&#39;t snow as heavily as does up north like in Beijing for example. It does snow, but usually we just get a little bit. Every time I see children having a snowball flight or making a snowman on TV, I really envy them.
- What&#39;s the weather (usually) like in your hometown?
  - I believe though China is a vast country, there are four distinct seasons in most places. But unfortunately in recent years, many places are becoming boiling hot in the summer. I guess the changes are primarily due to the greenhouse effect. So in this extreme weather, I will really prefer to work at home, and the air- conditioning is working all day long, and at night, I even sleep on the floor to be cooler.
