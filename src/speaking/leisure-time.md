- What do you do in your spare time?
  - Well, I enjoy driving around in my spare time. I always drive my car with my friends or family out to the countryside during the weekends to relax. I feel that driving not only enables me to go where I want to at any time, but I can also make my own itineraries and discover the stunning places that others may not find.
- What do you do to relax?
  - Normally, I&#39;ll hang out with my friends because I want to relax, but after being a father, I spend more time at home with my kid, telling stories to him or playing games with him.
- How do you usually spend your evenings?
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably spend more time at home with my kid, telling stories to him or playing games with him, whereas, hanging out with friends will reduce my quality family time with my son.
- What do you usually do after work&#x2F;after classes?
  - Oh, definitely not, you know, a modern lifestyle brings people more convenience, however, in this modern fast paced society the fierce competition makes more people spend more time at work, resulting in less quality time with family and friends.
- Do you prefer to stay at home in the evenings or do you prefer to go out?
  - Yes, definitely. After a tiring week, people really need to relax. Apart from earning money, I still need to enjoy my family time, hang out with friends to socialise and travel around to experience different lifestyles.
- Do you think modern lifestyles give people enough time for leisure?
  - Well, between the two, old people are fond of a slow-pace of life compared to young people, for example, old people enjoy walking in the garden or chatting with old friends, on the contrary, young people are fond of energetic activities such as football and hiking in the mountains.
- Do you think people today have more time to relax than in the past?
  - Well, it&#39;s kind of hard to say but people that I know around me tend to hang out with friends for dinner, but maybe for others, they will probably go shopping with family in the shopping malls to enjoy themselves.
