## Answers

- Can you swim?
  - Yes I can. I learnt at school when I was about 7 years old. Swimming lessons were compulsory at our school, like at most schools I think.
- Are there many places to swim near you?
  - Yes, there are a few public swimming pools. There is the main indoor one at a big sports complex in the centre of town. There are also a couple of outdoor ones, but you can only use them in summer, as it is too cold in winter. There is a big one in a park, whereas the other is much smaller.
- Do you think everyone should learn to swim?
  - Of course, I think it&#39;s very important to learn to swim. First, you might spend a lot of holidays by water, for example, when you go to the beach or go to a lake, so you won&#39;t be able to enjoy yourself with your friends if you can&#39;t swim. Also, for safety reasons it&#39;s very important. You often hear about accidents involving young children so it&#39;s very important.
