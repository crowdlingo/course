- When was your last time worked with a team?
  - The last time I worked in a team was a project I did during the second year of my graduate school. Our tutor gave us an assignment to review the server log of an international trade website and give a brief analysis using data warehouse and data mining technology.
- Do you like to work or study with others or just by yourself?
  - Personally, I would like to work in a team because I&#39;d have partner to share the responsibility with and we could solve problems better, as the saying goes “Many hands make light work&quot;
- What&#39;s the most important thing for teamwork?
  - I think the most important thing for teamwork is deciding who does what. Every member of team should be assigned specific tasks and he or she should stick to that. Also team spirit is equally important
