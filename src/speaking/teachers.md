- Do you have a favourite teacher?
  - My favourite teacher in my middle school was my physics teacher his name was Mr. Zhang. He was the most influential teacher I have ever had. He taught us a lot of background stuff about physics to encourage and motivate us because physics is quite complicated and difficult for us. I still remember that he frequently told us that physics was gymnastics for the brain. He really inspired my enthusiasm to learn it as well as I could.
- Why do you like the teacher?
  - I don&#39;t think I would be a good teacher; I am not a patient man and cannot bear to repeat the same things frequently. A teachers&#39; job would be really boring for me, you have to make your explanations as easy as possible for students to fully understand. It is a challenging job, I am afraid I cannot do it.
