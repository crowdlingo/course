## Answers

- What&#39;s your favourite colour?
  - My favourite colour is blue; for me it is the colour of depth and stability. Blue symbolises wisdom, confidence and intelligence. I don&#39;t like the pink because it is too girly.
- Are there any colours you dislike (Why?)
  - I suppose so. You know, different colours convey different meaning to people. Red represents passion and enthusiasm while green can be energetic. So I always choose the most suitable colours for things.
- Are colours important to you?
  - Well, yes, I have several blue clothes when I wear them I tend to feel calmer and more tranquil. I believe that blue is always a fashionable choice for a manâ€™s outfit.
- Were colours important to you when you were a child?
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with dark colours because I believe dark colours represent stability and wisdom, for example I would always choose a dark outfit for my office to highlight my professionalism, whereas light suits are more suitable for the younger generation.
- When you are buying something, is the colour important to you?

  - I would like to paint my walls light yellow or light blue because light colours convey warmth and are calm to which, in my opinion, are more suitable for the living rooms.
