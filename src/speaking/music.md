- Do you often like to listen to music?
  - Yes, I’ve been a big fan of music for many years. I sometimes listen to music for about one hour before sleeping at night and also when I am driving. I am very fond of pop music from Taiwan and Hong Kong and I also frequently listen to some American pop singers like the Backstreet Boys. I can feel their energy when I listen to their music.
- When do you listen to music?
  - Personally, I am interested in traditional instrumental music, like the erhu, mixed with pianos and guitars.
- How much time do you spend listening to music every day?
  - I always have time to listen to music during the weekends. It is an impressive combination that is both nostalgic and modern at the same time. I first encountered this type of music when I was driving and listening to the radio about five years ago, I forget the name, but the tune sounded really amazing.
- What kinds of music do you like to listen to?
  - Oh, yes, I saw a pop singer perform several years ago. It was a really memorable night as the live performances were very exciting. I remembered that after the song, when the singer spoke to the audience, everyone cheered and clapped like crazy. It made me feel so cool being there.
- What&#39;s your favourite kind of music?
  - Unfortunately, I did not learn to play any type of musical instrument when I was a little boy. I remember that in schools, teachers always told us to put all our energy into studying and preparing for exams. The music lessons, along with physical exercises and paintings, were not so important as the schools claimed them to be. It was a disappointment for me when I grew up.
