:::

- Do you like to learn about history?
  - Yes, I am a big fan of reading historical stories. When I was a little boy, I always took the historical books from my father&#39;s bookshelf and read about historical events. I feel that history not only helps me learn, but also gives me a better understanding of human society.
- What historical event do you find most interesting?
  - Personally I am fond of the Battle of Red Cliffs which happened during the early period of the Three Kingdoms. This was a decisive battle at the end of the Han Dynasty. It was also a typical battle in Chinese history renowned for a smaller and weaker army defeating a larger and stronger foe.
- Do you think history is important?
  - Yes, the main factor is that like our native language and our history forms our cultural identity and provides a unique record of our country. We can learn from the experiences of history to correct our current actions.
- Do you like to watch programmes on TV about history?
  - Yes, I enjoy watching documentaries about history on TV because I can see a lot of materials that cannot be seen in the textbooks. I watch them at home during my time off with my son to learn something about history.
- Do you think you can really learn history from films and TV programmes?
  - I don&#39;t feel that watching current TV series can make you more aware of the history. TV programmes are more engaging than books, however, true historical events in most of the TV series have been distorted by the producers to cater for the audience. It&#39;s really a shame, as young people will misunderstand history as presented by these companies.
