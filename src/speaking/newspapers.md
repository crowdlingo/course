## Answers

- Do you often read newspapers?
  - Not very often. Newspapers take time to get published so they are not updated as quickly as the news on social media sites is. Besides, I would have to go to the kiosks and spend money to buy newspapers.
- Which do you prefer reading, magazines or newspapers?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with reading magazines in my spare time because they are well printed and always have in-depth reporting on particular events; whereas, you know, newspapers always report the same news as the Internet, so they now seem to be not so indispensable.
- What kinds of newspapers (or magazines) do you usually read?
  - I&#39;m more interested in newspapers that write about foreign cultures. I like to learn about their religions, customs, and the foods they eat. Occasionally, foreign news interests me, too. I also really like reading scientific related news.
- How old were you when you first started to read newspapers?
  - I got in the habit of reading newspapers when I was in high school; I was around 17 years old then. The library in my school had several kinds of newspapers and magazines so when I had free time, I&#39;d go to read news about the latest political events, sports and fashion news.

- What different types of newspapers are there in China?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I&#39;ll probably go with reading domestic news because it is closer to home, and it affects me more; whereas, you know, international news sometimes have nothing to do with my daily life, so I just read the headlines.
