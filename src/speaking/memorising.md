- What do you remember to do every day?
  - Well, there are many things I have to remember to do every day. For example, after getting up in the morning, I need to do simple physical exercises like crunches and push-ups. Besides, another important thing to keep in mind is to teach my son to read traditional Chinese poems in the evening.
- What helps people to remember things?
  - Well, it&#39;s kind of hard to say but people I know use to-do-list apps on their mobile phones to help them remember what to do next; but maybe for other people, they might just write urgent things down in notebooks the old fashioned way with paper and pen.
- Why do old people forget about things easily?
  - Well, I guess it&#39;s quite normal that elderly people become more and more forgetful. Apart from some negative emotional factors like stress and depression, elderly people tend to forget things because of the normal ageing process.
- Have you ever forgotten something important?
  - Oh yes, I nearly forgot the birthday of a woman I liked. I had asked her what her birthday was, and told her I would send her a gift, but unbelievably I forgot it until the evening of that day. Fortunately I asked her out to dinner to celebrate and I saved the day.
