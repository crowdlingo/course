:::

- Do you like reading books? Why or why not?
  - Yes, I&#39;m really into reading because I believe that reading can be both entertaining and educational. Reading broadens my knowledge by opening up the whole world to me. While I&#39;m reading, I can be visiting another country or a different time period, or travelling through space. I can find out how people solved problems or think up new ideas.
- What (kinds of) books do you like to read?
  - Oh, it&#39;s a tough question, or it should be more of what books I don&#39;t read. I have a really open mind towards books and what genre they are. Classic literature, novels, autobiography, historical story - whatever I love reading them all.
- Did you read much when you were a child?
  - Yes, I remember when I was a kid, I&#39;d like to take some historical books from my father&#39;s bookshelf, and read the historical stories, which were really entertaining and educational for me. As a result, I&#39;m very familiar with our ancient Chinese history.
- What (kinds of) books did you like reading when you were a child?
  - It&#39;s kind of hard to say but young children that I know tend to read fairy tales to cultivate their mental development, but maybe for others, they just want to watch TV and play with their toys.
- Do (young) children like reading books?
  - I believe if you want your children to be smart, they have to acquire a love for reading, which has numerous benefits. Reading opens the door to a child&#39;s early academic success, imparts a love of learning and leads to higher grades in every subject. Besides, reading can help children improve linguistic skills in the form of a richer vocabulary, correct grammar, and more articulate oral communication. On top of that, books teach child about relationships, situations, personalities, and what is good and what is bad in the world he&#x2F;she lives in.
