:::

- Do you write many letters or emails?
  - Yes, I write emails as part of my job to my clients on a daily basis. There are many things I have to write, for example, I usually write end user training for my clients to teach them how to use the system, or I write a development guide for my technical staff to tell them how to code.
- Who do you usually write to?
  - If I had to choose between the two, I&#39;d probably go with writing with a computer. In this age of fast living and convenience, writing things with a computer is more efficient. Whereas, handwriting is really time consuming and hard to share.
- Do you prefer to write letters by hand or to use a computer?
  - Well, between the two, a letter is printed or handwritten on actual paper and sent through the mail while an email is typed on a computer, tablet or Smartphone and sent electronically. While emails have become a more popular way of communication for individuals and businesses, traditional letters still have a place in today&#39;s modern, tech-oriented society.
- How often do you write an email or a letter?
  - Normally part of my daily routine is to write emails to my clients about how to use the system; but if they complain to me about a poor user experience, I sometimes really find myself getting stuck in to explaining what went wrong just to comfort them.
- What are the differences between emails and letters?
  - I would be feeling both honoured and excited to receive a letter or email from someone because the sender has spent time writing it. Especially when someone writes to me to appreciate what I’ve done or to compliment me about my work.
- Is it hard to think of what to write?
  - Well, if I had to choose between the two, I will probably go with writing an email because I can spend plenty of time thinking about how to express my opinions correctly and clearly, besides, the whole conversation can be tracked in the electronic mail; whereas, you know, making a telephone call usually leads to misunderstanding because sometimes it is not very clear and things get missed
- What kinds of letter&#x2F;email do you think is the hardest to write?
  - I believe that as a major method of communication between people, letter writing has a long and interesting history; besides, handwritten letters are personal. They show the receiver that someone has spent time and effort in communicating with them. They are a way of connecting two people that cannot be achieved through the impersonal use of texts or instant messages. Therefore, I think that handwritten letters will still be around in the future.
