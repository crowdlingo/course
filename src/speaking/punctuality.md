## Answers

- Do you think its Important to be on time?
  - Yeah, I think it definitely is, because it&#39;s basic good manners to be on time for things. You know, I think you&#39;d agree it&#39;s pretty rude to keep people waiting, and so it kind of gives a bad impression about that person.
- How do you feel when others are late?
  - Well I guess it kind of depends, because I mean, if there&#39;s a good reason for being late, you know, like getting stuck in traffic, then I will not really mind that much. But you know, if the person does not really have any excuse and it&#39;s simply because they could not be bothered to arrive on time, then I suppose I might feel a bit annoyed.
- Are you, yourself, late very often?- How do you feel when you are late?
  - (If yes) Yeah, I am. And I know it&#39;s a bad habit, but for some reason, no matter how hard I try, I always seem to end up being late for things!
- How do you think you could be on time?
  - (If no) No, I would not say I am. You know, most of the time I&#39;m pretty good with being on time for things, because I always make a quite big effort not to be late.
- Do you wear a watch?
  - I feel pretty bad, especially if I&#39;ve kept the other person waiting for a long time. So if I know Iâ€™m gonna be late, I will always try to let the person know in advance, you know, like send them a text message or something, so at least they know when to expect me.
- When does time SEEM to move fast, and when does it SEEM to move Slowly?
  - I guess the best thing to do would be to always allow lots of time to get anywhere. So for example, if it normally takes me, say, half an hour to get to the city centre, then I should probably leave home about an hour before I need to get there.
- If you could go back in time, what would you do differently?
  - (If yes) Yeah I do - you can see it right here!
