- What kind of accommodation do you live in?
  - We live in a pretty spacious apartment in Nanjing. I live on the 8th floor of a high- rise, and its size about 120 square metres. It is a fairly nice place. 
- Do you live in a house or a flat?
  - An Apartment. Our apartment has six rooms - one living room, one kitchen, two bathrooms and another two bedrooms. All of them are well decorated and furnished. There is a big bookshelf beside my brother’s room so that my brother can easily get books to read. In addition, we have a big balcony outside so that we can enjoy eating dinner and having tea there.
- Who do you live with?
  - I live with my mum and dad and my brother. Our apartment is pretty big so there is enough space for everyone.
- Do you plan to live there for a long time?
  - We bought the apartment four years ago. And my brother is in the school near my home, so we won&#39;&#39;t intend to move in the future.&#39;
- Are the transport facilities to your home very good?
  - We sometimes go out by car because it is not convenient to take a taxi in that area, and it takes nearly 30 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station. So generally speaking, it is not good to go out without a car.
