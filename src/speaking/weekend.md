- How do you usually spend your weekends?
  - Normally I&#39;ll go out to some stunning natural places to let off steam with my family or friends on weekends; but if it&#39;s not sunny, I&#39;ll stay at home for the whole weekend. Mostly I just use the Internet to kill time.
- In your country, do men and women usually do the same kind of things on weekends?
  - I guess some men play sports while women may just do housework. So men may probably do things for their own interest, by contrast, women spend more time for their families.
- When do you spend time with your family?
  - I always spend the whole weekends with my family. I barely work on weekends.
- What do you usually do on weekends?
  - Last weekend, I took my son to the Nanjing Botanic Garden to go to see the various plants. We went into the greenhouse exhibition of plants which was very remarkable.
- What did you do last weekend?
  - Well, there are so many people in my hometown, it&#39;s really hard to say, probably most people tend to stay at home to enjoy family time, but personally speaking, I guess there are not too many entertainments in my small hometown for people to go to.
