## Answers

- How do you usually spend your weekends?
  - Normally I&#39;ll go out to some stunning natural places to let off steam with my family or friends on weekends; but if it&#39;s not sunny, I&#39;ll stay at home for the whole weekend. Mostly I just use the Internet to kill time.
- In your country, do men and women usually do the same kind of things on weekends?

- What do other people in your hometown usually do on weekends?
  - Next week, I plan to do some shopping because as the Spring Festival is just around the corner, I need to go to the supermarket to buy food and other groceries; besides, I have to buy some new clothes for my family for the coming New Year, it&#39;s an old Chinese tradition.

- Do you think employees should have to work on weekends?
