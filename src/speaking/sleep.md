## Answers

- How many hours do you sleep every day?
  - Usually I sleep for seven to eight hours every night in order to let my body relax. But if I want to do something very important at night, I could, at a push, sleep for less than four hours.
- Is it necessary to take a nap every day?
  - Yes, I believe that after having lunch at noon, it&#39;s beneficial to take a nap; half an hour’s snooze would be enough, to brace oneself for the tasks of the afternoon.
- Do old people sleep a lot? Why?
  - Yes, I guess elderly people do need to sleep more. I believe the reason is that after years of working and stress the natural process breaks down a person’s body until all they want to do is sleep; consequently, their bodies take longer to recharge their batteries.
- How to have a good sleep?
  - I believe you have to follow several rules to get a regular good nights sleep. Firstly, go to bed at the same time every night. Choose a time when you normally feel tired, so that you don&#39;t toss and turn. Also, make sure your bed is comfortable so that you can stretch and turn in bed. As well as that, stay away from big meals at night or try to make dinnertime earlier in the evening, and avoid heavy, rich foods before bed.
- Do you like to get up early in the morning?
  - Yes, getting up early in the morning is really beneficial for our health, because we can enjoy the fresh air in the morning; besides we have plenty of time to do some physical exercises liking running and jogging. In the morning I can also prepare a good dinner for the family.
- Can you sleep well if you are in a noisy environment?
  - Well, I&#39;m afraid that at night I can&#39;t fall asleep in such a noisy place what with barking dogs, loud neighbours and city traffic. This is because I used to sleep in my quiet hometown when I was a kid. So sometimes I envy people who have grown accustomed to environmental noise and can sleep well wherever they lay their head.
