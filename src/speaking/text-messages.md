## Answers

- Is there any chance when texting someone is better than calling him?
  - I believe when the person Iâ€™m calling is in a conference or in a cinema, it&#39;s better to text him instead of making a telephone call.

- How often do you send text messages?
  - I send text messages almost on a daily basis. I always text my friends and family to say hello, chat and make travelling plans.
