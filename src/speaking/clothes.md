:::

- What clothes do you usually like to wear?
  - Well, actually I don&#39;t have any instinct for fashion and my look says I&#39;m a laid- back kind of guy. So I usually wear casual clothes. I&#39;m most comfortable wearing jeans, a T-shirt and my flip-flops.
- Do&#x2F;did you wear the same clothes at school and at home?
  - Oh, definitely not. I always wore school uniform which was a blue jacket with a white shirt. They were very simple and boring. So when I reached home, I tended to put on my favourite outfits.
- Will you change your clothes when you go home today?
  - Oh, yes. Formal clothes really make me nervous so when I go home, I take them off and change into my sweatshirts.
- Did you have any special clothes to wear when you where a child?
  - Yes, when I was a child, I needed to wear a uniform at school from primary school all the way to the very last year of high school; it is a tradition in China, so I believe my parents had to follow this tradition too.
- Did you like them?
  - No, I really couldn&#39;t stand the school uniform because the clothes were a bit too old- fashioned; in addition, sometimes I was reluctant to wear them because they were too large. I don’t know why they couldn&#39;t be a bit more trendy and colourful like the ones in other countries, like Japan and Australia.
