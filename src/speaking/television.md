- How much TV do you usually watch?
  - I seldom watch TV. I only turn on the TV to watch a football match on weekends. That is once a week. I am a big fan of football so I watch a lot of football matches. It&#39;s exciting and entertaining to see how players push their limits to win the games. I also enjoy watching movies, especially when I connect my computer to the TV screen and watch movies in High Definition from my bed; it is really enjoyable at night.
- What&#39;s your favourite TV programme?
  - Lately I have tried to watch BBC programmes, because they are all in English and it can improve my listening for my IELTS exams.
- Did you watch much TV when you were a child? (How much?)
  - Oh, yes, I really was a couch potato when I was younger. On weekends, when my parents went out to do other things, I was left alone at home with the TV all day long. 
- What (types of) programmes did you watch when you were a child?
  - I became obsessed with various TV programmes, including the adverts. I can still remember my favourite cartoons like Transformers, Tom and Jerry, Dragon Ball, etc, which I watched all through my childhood.
- Do you think television has changed since you were a child?
  - Yes, as the techniques have advanced in these years, the TV has also developed a lot. They have become thinner and clearer to be exact. I remember those old TV screens were made with a plasma panel, making the whole TV heavy and big. Then LCD technology and the LED display came out making the TV thinner and lighter so we can enjoy brighter and clearer programmes.
- Has television changed your life in any way?
  - I believe that watching TV has benefited me in some way, as well as bringing me some detrimental consequences. Watching TV programmes had enabled me to broaden my horizons as I was born and raised in a small county and there were many places and things I had no opportunities to experience. But the TV had helped me to see them. But spending too much time in front of TV also made meaddicted to it and unfortunately harmed my eyes. So I’ve had to wear glasses since middle school
